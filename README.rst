A Web Processing Service Testbed
--------------------------------

Flyingpigeon is a server providing a sandbox and test environment for new Web Processing Services (OGC WPS). It is part of the `birdhouse`_ ecosystem, which aims to build interoperable services in support to substainable development goals. Once stable, mature and thoroughly tested, Flyingpigeon services are meant to move to stand-alone thematic servers used in production.

The Flyingpigeon software stack as of version 1.0 was published in `Computers & Geosciences <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300416302801>`_ and can still be accessed from the `release page <https://github.com/bird-house/flyingpigeon/releases/tag/1.0.0>`_. Meanwhile many of the 1.0 processes have migrated to other birdhouse repositories. For example, processes related to extreme weather event assessment can be found in `blackswan`_, while processes focusing on climate indices will be found in `finch`_.
