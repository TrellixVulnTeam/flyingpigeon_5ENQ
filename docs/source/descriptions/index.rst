.. _processes:


Flyingpigeon provides processes for climate model data analysis, climate impact studies and investigations of extremes.
A combination of processes will be called a 'workflow'.

.. note:: Flyingpigeon is a bird to develop and test processes and functions. Once they are in a major status they move to an other service.
